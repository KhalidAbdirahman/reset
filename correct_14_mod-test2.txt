Risin' up, ba
ck on the str
eet
Did my time, 
took my chanc
es
Went the dist
ance, now I'm
 back on my f
eet
Just a man an
d his will to
 survive
So many times
, it happens 
too fast
You trade you
r passion for
 glory
Don't lose yo
ur grip on th
e dreams of t
he past
You must figh
t just to kee
p them alive
It's the eye 
of the tiger,
 it's the thr
ill of the fi
ght
Risin' up to 
the challenge
 of our rival
And the last 
known survivo
r stalks his 
prey in the n
ight
And he's watc
hin' us all w
ith the eye o
f the tiger
Face to face,
 out in the h
eat
Hangin' tough
, stayin' hun
gry
They stack th
e odds 'til w
e take to the
 street
For the kill 
with the skil
l to survive
It's the eye 
of the tiger,
 it's the thr
ill of the fi
ght
Risin' up to 
the challenge
 of our rival
And the last 
known survivo
r stalks his 
prey in the n

And he's watc
hin' us all w
ith the eye o
f the tiger
Risin' up, st
raight to the
 top
Had the guts,
 got the glor
y
Went the dist
ance, now I'm
 not gonna st
op
Just a man an
d his will to

It's the eye 
of the tiger,
 it's the thr

Risin' up to 
the challenge
 of our rival
And the last

The eye of th

The eye of th
