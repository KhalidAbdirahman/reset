You can't stop an avalanche as it races down the 
hill.
You can try to stop the seasons girl but you know
 you never will.
And you can try to stop my dancin' feet but I jus
t cannot stand still.
Cause the world keeps spinning round and round.
And my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound
.
I was lost til I heard the drums then I found my 
way.
Cause you can't stop the beat.
