You can't stop an a
valanche as it race
s down the hill.
You can try to stop
 the seasons girl b
ut you know you nev
er will.
And you can try to 
stop my dancin' fee
t but I just cannot
 stand still.
Cause the world kee
ps spinning round a
nd round.
And my heart's keep
ing time to the spe
ed of sound.
I was lost til I he
ard the drums then 
I found my way.
Cause you can't sto
p the beat.
